The Law Offices Of Joseph A. Bondy represent businesses and individuals at every level of the cannabis supply chain. Our clients include state-licensed adult-use marijuana, medical marijuana and hemp cultivators, processors, distributors and dispensaries, whether vertically integrated or operating as standalone businesses, as well as investors in those businesses. We also represent the full range of business vendors that supply their products and services to the cannabis industry, such as raw materials, technology, advertising, social media, consumption products and security companies. We have advised a wide variety of non-cannabis companies, including traditional consumer goods companies, real estate developers, insurance companies, banks, media companies, government contractors, broker-dealers, and private equity and venture capital funds in evaluating the regulatory and business considerations pertinent to entering into the cannabis space.

Our attorneys have gained comprehensive, hands-on, cannabis-related experience and apply that knowledge to advise clients based in the United States, Canada and other countries on the federal, state and local laws, regulations and governmental guidance relevant to conducting business and investing in cannabis. This includes the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (also known as the 2018 Farm Bill), Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidance, and state-specific marijuana and hemp regulations.

We assist our cannabis-related clients in understanding and assessing the federal and state regulatory framework for cannabis; applications for licenses to operate and related administrative matters; commercial litigation; negotiating and documenting investments, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions; conducting due diligence on the targets of such transactions; federal, state and local tax issues; day-to-day regulatory advice and general business counsel; and labor and employment, including workplace training and litigating workplace claims.

We have provided corporate governance and capital formation advice on both public and private securities offerings on behalf of privately and publicly held cannabis companies, including serving as counsel in the first investment-bank led public offering by a U.S. cannabis company. Additionally, we served as lead counsel for the first-ever trademark infringement action arising out of cannabis branding, and regularly represent clients in patent and trademark protection and enforcement matters.
