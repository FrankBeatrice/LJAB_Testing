The Law Offices of Joseph A. Bondy provides counsel and strategic consulting to companies, entrepreneurs and investors involved in the legal cannabis industry, across a broad spectrum of issues. Our clients include cultivators, processors, dispensaries, ancillary businesses, entrepreneurs, and investors. The Office also offers due diligence on the regulatory and business considerations of clients' entering into particular cannabis-related transactions.

Given Mr. Bondy's 25-year background as a federal criminal defense attorney, the Office has decades of high-level federal and state cannabis-related enforcement experience, and the comprehensive knowledge required to peerlessly guide clients on international, federal, state and local laws, and the regulatory and governmental hurdles unique to conducting business and investing in the industry. Mr. Bondy has a nuanced understanding of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and related federal criminal laws, including the federal securities, money laundering, and criminal and civil forfeiture statutes. He also has decades of experience representing clients in matters involving the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and other law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Mr. Bondy's national cannabis advocacy efforts and ongoing representation of cannabis industry clients, have provided him with a close familiarity of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ("the 2018 Farm Bill"), and both US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations related to cannabis and hemp.

The Office counsels its cannabis-related clients in understanding and evaluating the proper federal and state regulatory rubric for achieving their cannabis-related goals; the application processes for licenses to operate and related administrative matters; commercial litigation; joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions; conducting due diligence on the individuals involved in these transactions; and providing ongoing regulatory advice and business counsel.

We have provided strategic corporate and capital formation advice for private securities offerings on behalf of cannabis-related clients, and are deeply committed to social justice reform and the unfettered legalization of cannabis. Ongoing evidence of this commitment is seen in Mr. Bondy's work as the Vice President of the not-for-profit Cannabis Cultural Association (CCA), and as pro bono counsel in the land-mark federal cannabis lawsuit Washington v. Barr, which alleges that cannabis' scheduling under the CSA was a product of racial division and an ongoing refusal to acknowledge its medical efficacy.

High Times Magazine identifies Mr. Bondy as "One of the Nation's Preeminent Cannabis Attorneys," while the New York Times has called him, "Eloquent and Armed with the Serene Demeanor of a Surgeon."

The Law Offices Of Joseph A. Bondy are at the vanguard of the cannabis industry, providing visionary leadership through speaking at legal, business, equity, and community events nation-wide, while serving clients with cutting-edge counsel in this ever-changing, dynamic field.
