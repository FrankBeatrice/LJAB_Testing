In every matter, civil and criminal,the attorney must develop a strong theory and supporting themes, which simply and persuasively explain why they should win. Developing the best theory and themes of the case allows a practitioner to utilize the dominant emotion and relevant law to their advantage throughout every stage of the litigation. Learning how to brainstorm, identify, and properly deploy the themes in furtherance of the theory is of critical importance to maximizing one’s chances of prevailing at trial.
