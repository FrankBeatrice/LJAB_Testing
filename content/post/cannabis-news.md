In every matter, civil and criminal, the attorney must develop a strong theory and supporting themes, which simply and persuasively explain why they should win. Developing the best theory and themes of the case allows a practitioner to utilize the dominant emotion and relevant law to their advantage throughout every stage of the litigation.
