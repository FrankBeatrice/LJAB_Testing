Under our American system of jurisprudence, the presumption of innocence and right to the counsel of one's choice are fundamental Constitutional tenets, which extend to everybody. For nearly twenty-five years, Joseph A. Bondy has been committed to protecting individuals' rights, shielding people from the power of the state, while winning state and federal acquittals, dismissals, deferred prosecutions, sentence reductions, and appellate and post-conviction reversals.

Mr. Bondy treats every client's matter individually, from pre-charging to post-conviction. Every case is distinct, as are the matrix of client, prosecutor, witnesses, allegations, and evidence. Through securing pre-trial release, to developing winning theories and themes of the defense, writing successful pleadings, and zealously representing our clients' interests at hearings and trials, the aim of the Office is to  prevail in each matter, whether by acquittal, dismissal, reduced sentence, or reversal.

Below are just a few of the results of Mr. Bondy’s dedicated criminal advocacy:
